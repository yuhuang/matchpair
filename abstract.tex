Message passing programs are notoriously difficult for analysis. A feasible approach is encoding a program into an SMT problem with a set of match pairs (each contains a send and a receive that potentially match in the runtime). The approach is inefficient as the match pairs are over-approximated such that they imply exponential ways of message communication. This paper presents a new algorithm that under-approximates the match pairs iteratively: first sectioning each process in the program based on the user input, and then generates the match pairs for each section independently by simple rules with ranking. This paper further presents that the precise match pairs can be generated with a bounded input. The experiments show that the new algorithm drastically reduces the runtime cost of analysis for message passing programs, and that the algorithm scales to programs with high degrees of message non-determinism and/or high degrees of deep communication.
