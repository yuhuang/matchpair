\section{Coverage of Message Communication}

As discussed earlier, a send and a receive from two different sections are not considered for matching. For example, the match pair  $\langle r_1\ s_1\rangle$ can not be generated by the algorithm in this paper with $k=1$ for the CTP in \figref{fig:example} as the receive $r_1$ and the send $s_1$ are partitioned into two sections. The example also indicates that this match pair can be generated when $r_1$ and $s_1$ are grouped into a single section, where $k\geq2$.  
Note that all the precise match pairs for the CTP in \figref{fig:example} are generated with $k=3$.

It is believed that the algorithm with a larger input $k$ is able to approximate more match pairs. Further, \thmref{theorem:precise} states that the precise match pairs for any CTP can be generated given an appropriate input $k$.
The function $\mathrm{MAX}$ returns the maximum among a set of numbers.
 
\begin{theorem}
The complete set of the precise match pairs for a CTP can be over-approximated by \algoref{algo:main} given a positive integer $k$, where $k \geq$ $\mathrm{MAX}$ $(\ceil*{\frac{\mathit{NR_{1}}}{|frm_1|}},\ldots,\ceil*{\frac{\mathit{NR_{|P|}}}{|frm_{|P|}|}})$.
\label{theorem:precise}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Since all the sends and receives are added to the sections by \algoref{algo:main} (\lemmaref{lemma:section}), the number of sends is equal to the number of receives for any section (\lemmaref{lemma:distribute}), and \textrm{MATCHAPPROX} is able to over-approximate the precise match pairs for any section (\lemmaref{lemma:match}), the only way to approximate all the precise match pairs for a CTP is to add all the receives in each process to a single section. Therefore, the proof must claim that there is exactly one section for each process, assuming $k \geq$ $\mathrm{MAX}$ $(\ceil*{\frac{\mathit{NR_{1}}}{|frm_1|}},\ldots,\ceil*{\frac{\mathit{NR_{|P|}}}{|frm_{|P|}|}})$. Applying a feasible assignment of $k$ to equation (3), it is trivial to prove that $N_k = \mathit{NR_{t}}$ for each process $p_t$. As such, all the precise match pairs for the CTP can be over-approximated.
$\Box$
