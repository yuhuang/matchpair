\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
In this paper, we propose an effective under-approximation algorithm that is able to reduce the redundancy of the match pairs. Intuitively, the new algorithm is the dynamic sectioning with a user input where each process of a message passing program is sectioned. Then, the new algorithm generates the match pairs for each section independently, and the commands from different sections are not considered for matching. Therefore, the number of the generated match pair set is highly reduced. The manuscript further proves that the precise match pairs for any message passing program can be generated by our algorithm with a sufficiently large bound $k$. Results show that our algorithm can significantly improve the performance of symbolic model checking by dynamic sectioning. In particular, our algorithm can outperform the existing over-approximation algorithm and two state-of-the-art message passing verifiers in the time cost, which means our algorithm is more timely and costless. Experiments also show that our algorithm scales to a program that employs a high degree of message non-determinism and/or a high degree of deep communication.

The symbolic model checking with UAMP also has some weaknesses. 
First, the approach is restricted to the CTP abstraction that only reveals the behavior from an execution trace given a concrete input. 
As such, program behavior may be ignored in analysis, even though multiple CTPs are checked.
In the future, our work will explore to extend the symbolic model checking to support more structures such as branches and loops. 
Such an extension will correctly resolve the behavior for these structures. 
Second, our algorithm does not scale well to a program with wide communication due to how a process is sectioned. 
Future work will consider new approach to section processes so that programs with various communication types are supported.
%Future work will explore to extend the algorithm in this paper to support these structures. As discussed earlier, the algorithm in this paper does not scale well to a program with wide communication due to how a process is sectioned. Future work will consider new ways to section processes so that programs with various communication types are supported.
