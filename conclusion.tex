\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
This paper presents a new algorithm that generates the match pairs for a message passing program in the context of a CTP.
First, the algorithm sections each process for the sequential receives where the input $k$ is used to compute the number of receives in each section.
Second, the algorithm distributes the same number of sends from multiple senders to match those receives in each section. Finally, the algorithm approximates the match pairs by comparing the ranks for all the sends and receives in each section. The key insight of the algorithm in this paper is that the match pairs for each section are generated independently. 
A send and a receive from two different sections can not be considered for matching. 
This paper also proves that all the precise match pairs for a CTP can be generated with an appropriate input $k$. Experiments demonstrate that all the errors in the benchmarks can be efficiently detected with under-approximated match pairs generated by the new algorithm. 

A restriction of the new algorithm is that it is incapable of approximating the match pairs for sends and receives from branches. Future work will explore new approach to handle branches.
