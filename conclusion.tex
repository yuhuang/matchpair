\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
This paper presents a new algorithm that generates the match pairs for a message passing program iteratively. First, the algorithm matches a section by adding a sequence of receives from a common process with a positive integer K that is given as input. Second, the algorithm distributes the same number of sends from multiple processes to match those receives. Finally, the algorithm approximates the match pairs by comparing the ranks for all the potential sends and receives in the section. The key insight of the paper is that the algorithm is able to generate the match pairs for each section independently. A send and a receive from two different sections can not be considered for matching. This paper also proves that all the precise match pairs for any program can be generated with an appropriate input K. Experiments demonstrates that all the errors in the benchmarks can be efficiently detected with under-approximated match pairs generated by the new algorithm. 

A restriction of the new algorithm is that it is incapable of approximating the match pairs for sends and receives from branches. Future work will explore new approach to handle branches.
