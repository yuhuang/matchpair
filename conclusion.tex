\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
This paper presents a new algorithm that generates the match pairs for message passing programs in the context of a CTP.
First, the algorithm sections each process where each section contains roughly $k$ sends from each sender that may match the same number of receives in the section. The bound $k$ is a user input.
The algorithm then approximates the match pairs by comparing the ranks for all the sends and receives in each section \cite{DBLP:conf/kbse/HuangMM13}. The key insight of the algorithm in this paper is that the match pairs for each section are generated independently. 
A send and a receive from two different sections can not be considered for matching. 
This paper also presents that all the precise match pairs for a CTP can be generated with the \textit{max bound} of $k$. Experiments demonstrate that all the properties in the benchmarks can be efficiently witnessed with under-approximated match pairs generated by the new algorithm. Experiments also show that the algorithm is able to scale to a program that employs a high degree of message non-determinism and/or a high degree of deep communication.

A restriction of the new algorithm is that it is incapable of approximating the match pairs for sends and receives from branches. Future work will explore new approach to handle branches.
